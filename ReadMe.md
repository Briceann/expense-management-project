# Expense Management Project

## Problem Statement
Managing personal finances can be challenging, especially when individuals lack a structured
way to track daily expenses. Many people struggle with overspending, budgeting and categorizing their
expenditures, leading to financial instability. Existing expense tracking solutions may be too complex,
lack essential features, or fail to provide insightful reports for better financial decision making.

To address this issue, this project aims to develop a secure, user-friendly web application that
enables users to log their expenses, categorize transactions, and generate reports for better financial
management. The system will include authentication for data privacy, logging for monitoring activities, 
and essential features such as filtering, sorting, and graphic reports.By providing an efficient way
to track spending habits, this application will help users make informed financial decisions and stay within
their budget.
